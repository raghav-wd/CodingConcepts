## WHERE/Having
  is used to filter the records from the table/groups based on the specified condition.
  can/cannot be used without GROUP BY Clause
  implements in row/column operations
  cannot/can contain aggregate function
  
## Normalization
1NF - Table shouldn't contain any multivalued attribute
2NF - 1NF should be fulfilled. There should be no partial dependency
      Example - R(ABCD), AB ∈ D but B ∈ C, so C is partial dependent on B or partial dependent on CK which is against 2NF
      Soln - Create two tables => R1(ABD), AB ∈ D || R2(BC), B ∈ C
3NF - 2NF should be fulfilled. There should be no transitive dependency that is non prime attr. shouldn't find a non prime attr.
      Example - R(ABCD), AB ∈ C but C ∈ D, so D is transitive dependent on C or non prime attr. defining non prime which is against 3NF
      Soln - R1(ABC), AB ∈ C || R2(CD), C ∈ D


## Relational Database
It consist of tabls or relations

Degree - number of rows
Cardinality - number of columns
Tuples - rows or records
Field - columns
  ## Keys
Primary Key - Attribute which uniquely identifies a row
Candidate Key - There can be more than 1 attr. which uniquely identifies a row hence they are candidate key means they are candidate to become primary key
Alternate Key - Ck which is not chosen as Pk
